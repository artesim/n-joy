# n-joy
n-joy is a script engine for your HID devices.

It is my personal take on what the excellent Joystick Gremlin already does, but with added networking support and game state awareness.

## Project Reboot
This is a reboot of a code base I had started four years ago : I had abandoned the project and switched to the excellent Joystick Gremlin.

Since then, I learned a lot, and today I find myself wanting to add more game state awareness to my setup. I have a working solution integrating various parts but it's clunky. So I'm picking it up again.
